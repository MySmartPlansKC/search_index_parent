Quick Start Guide for Search Index Parent

1. Place the `search_index_parent` file in your `Path_to_your_closeout\CD_Root\AutoPlay` folder.
2. Make sure that all documents to be indexed are in the `\Docs` folder adjacent to `AutoPlay`.
3. Run the executable by double-clicking on it. The application will process all compatible files within the `Docs` folder and create an XML index.
4. The XML files will be saved in the `Docs` folder and their subsequent subfolders, detailing the structure and content of the indexed documents.
5. Remove the `search_index_parent` file and `search_builder_processing_log.txt` file upon completion

This setup ensures that your documents are automatically indexed when the executable is run.

If the program terminates prior to completion you are able to restart the process and continue where you left off.
